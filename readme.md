# Welcome! 😄

I am <strong>Marco Iamonte</strong> and I'm a professional software developer from Italy. I love to code 💻 and do stuff related to coding in general.

- 🔗 I'm on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2275797/briosheje) and [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/briosheje). I'm also on [dev.to](https://dev.to/briosheje) where I occasionally write articles emerging frameworks
- 🔗 I also used to be a [speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2008IAMO01), although i don't practice anymore I have an archive of some achievements and videos about speedcubing in general in my :video_camera: [youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4FzkPg7EA0B4iDwIzwZc0w).
- 🧑‍🍳 I love to cook.

I occasionally try to contribute to open source projects or make my own, my tech stack currently briefly consists of:

- Javascript
- Typescript
- Electron
- NodeJS
- React
- Angular
- Vue 3
- Next.JS
- Nuxt
- Astro
- Rust (a bit)
- C#
- Golang (a bit)
- Docker
- AWS
- Flutter
- ... and much more.

I'm extremely passionate about my work and I try to dedicate also my free time to keep myself updated on emerging technologies, always ready to learn something new and experiment on something unknown yet.
